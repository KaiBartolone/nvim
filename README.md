# Kai's NVIM Setup

This is where I keep my text editor settings and plugin lists.

## Installation
1. Install [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/)
2. Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and add to path
3. Install [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
4. Run PackerSync in nvim and troubleshoot
